# Page 74 - Using future versions of .NET with this book

In Step 3, I wrote, "You can also use new features in EF Core 11 because it will continue to target .NET 10."

And on page 342, I wrote, "When EF Core 11 is released in November 2026, we can expect it to target .NET 10 or later, so you can upgrade EF Core while still getting long-term support for the .NET 10 platform. The EF Core team is responsible for making sure that you will be able to swap 10 for 11 in the version number of their packages and your code should still work. They are usually very good at that, and they will document any needed changes to your code in the official release notes for EF Core 11."

On February 10, 2026, the EF Core team published packages for EF Core 11 Preview 1, and a page for what's new: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-11.0/whatsnew

It includes an important note: "EF11 requires the .NET 11 SDK to build and requires the .NET 11 runtime to run. EF11 will not run on earlier .NET versions, and will not run on .NET Framework."

In the past, the EF Core team often targeted the latest LTS .NET so you could adopt the new EF Core STS version without moving your whole app runtime. Microsoft’s own “Supported .NET implementations” page even states that as the general approach: “In general, we target the latest LTS release of .NET… There may be exceptions… as runtime features sometimes get added that require us to depend on the latest version of .NET.” From: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/miscellaneous/platforms

But EF Core 11 is now explicitly saying that it requires the .NET 11 SDK to build and the .NET 11 runtime to run, and it won’t run on earlier .NET versions.

Why? The EF team’s own platform guidance acknowledges that sometimes they must depend on the latest .NET due to runtime features. In practice, “won’t run on earlier .NET” usually means they’re compiling against and taking dependencies on assemblies/APIs that simply are not present (or not the same versions) on earlier runtimes, and the team has decided not to carry the extra compatibility shims or multi-targeting.

Net result: EF Core 11 only running on .NET 11 is the documented requirement. If you want to stay on .NET 10 LTS, EF Core 10 is the ceiling. If you move to .NET 11 (STS), EF Core 11 becomes available.
